For both users and developers, the [klee-dev](https://mailman.ic.ac.uk/mailman/listinfo/klee-dev) mailing list is the central place for discussions, questions, and announcements.

If you have queries about KLEE that are not answered on this website, please send a message to the list rather than opening a GitHub issue.

However, before sending your message, please check [klee-dev's searchable archive](http://www.mail-archive.com/klee-dev@imperial.ac.uk/) to see if your question has already been answered.

Please note that only subscribers can post messages to the list, so you would need to subscribe to the list first.  The first post of each member is moderated to avoid spam, so please allow up to a few days for your first message to be approved.
